### 1. Terraform Authentication Module

Created a comprehensive Cognito authentication module in terraform/modules/authentication/ that includes:

• User Pool configuration with email authentication
• Social identity provider integration (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple)
• User groups for role-based access control (users, agents, admins)
• Identity Pool for federated identities
• IAM roles and policies for authenticated users

### 2. Security Module

Added a security module in terraform/modules/security/ that provides:

• Security groups for database, application, and load balancer
• IAM roles for ECS tasks with appropriate permissions
• Policies for accessing S3, Cognito, and other services

### 3. Frontend Authentication Components

Created React components for authentication:

• src/lib/auth/cognito.ts: Utility functions for Cognito operations
• src/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx: React context for authentication state
• src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx: Form for email and social sign-in
• src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx: Form for user registration

### 4. Authentication Middleware and API Routes

Set up authentication middleware and API routes:

• src/middleware.ts: Protects routes based on authentication and roles
• src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts: NextAuth.js integration with Cognito

### 5. Configuration Files

Added configuration files:

• Updated Terraform variables and outputs to support authentication
• Created .env.example with required environment variables
• Added a comprehensive README-COGNITO.md guide

### Key Features

1. Multiple Authentication Methods:
   • Email/password authentication
   • Social identity providers (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple)

2. Role-Based Access Control:
   • User groups (users, agents, admins)
   • Route protection based on roles

3. Security Best Practices:
   • JWT token validation
   • Secure password policies
   • HTTPS enforcement

4. User Management:
   • Sign-up with email verification
   • Password reset functionality
   • Profile management

### Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation:
   • Create the necessary UI pages (signin, signup, profile)
   • Implement the protected routes

2. Configure social identity providers:
   • Set up developer accounts with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple
   • Generate client IDs and secrets
   • Configure redirect URIs

3. Deploy and test:
   • Apply the Terraform configuration
   • Set up environment variables
   • Test all authentication flows

The README-COGNITO.md file provides detailed instructions on how to set up and configure each social identity 
provider and integrate them with your application.
